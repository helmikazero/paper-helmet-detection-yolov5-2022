\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:kesimpulan}

\par From the results and analysis that have been done in the course of this research on "Hardhat Detection using CNN", several conclusion can be pointed out :

\begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]

    \item It is possible to utilize YOLOv5 for hardhat detection as proved in the test of each model with Pretrained Weights from YOLOv5 or without Pretrained Weights for each variant (N,S,M,L) where the average results of every models available : 0.92 for precision,  0.87 for recall and 0.92 for mAP@.5 which also had no significant difference between the variants.

    \item In the inference speed test, if sorted from fastest to slowest, they are Nano(N), Small(S), Medium(M), then Large(L) which also affects frame-rate as indicated in the Jetson Nano test where the N variant gets 18.4 FPS to the L variant which was getting 1.8 FPS

    \item Hardhat detection system can be carried out at a distance of 1 meter to 10 meters as proved by model testing getting an average value at all distances : 0.9 for precision,  0.97 for recall and 0.98 for mAP@.5 and 0.92 for accuracy from the alarm system accuracy test.

    \item The work safety helmet detection system can be carried out in low lighting as evidenced by model testing with the average value of all model variants : 0.76 for precision,  0.74 for recall and 0.78 for mAP@.5 and also from testing the alarm system with the Small variant getting a value of 0.82 for accuracy which indicates a decrease in performance in low lighting.

    \item The work safety helmet detection system can be executed real-time as shown in the system test at Jetson-Nano with an accuracy of 0.92.

    \item Considering the test results of all models where the difference is not too significant for their inference speed, the pretrained YOLOv5s weight from Small(S) model variant is considered the as the optimal choice for real-time hardhat detection which is then also used for all system tests in this research.
