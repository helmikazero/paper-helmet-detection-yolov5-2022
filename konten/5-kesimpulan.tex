\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:kesimpulan}

\par From the results and analysis that have been done in the course of this research on "Hardhat Detection using CNN", several conclusion can be pointed out :

\begin{enumerate}
    \item It is possible to utilize YOLOv5 object detection architecture to detect when personnel wear the hardhat or not. The test conducted on the model trained on Hardhat Detection Datasets works properly on detecting head without hardhat and head with hardhat, proved by the model performance test on the test set.
    \item The hardhat detection system, where the system will trigger an alarm when one or more people not wearing a hardhat within the captured frame from the camera, can be run on real-time input from a webcam or prerecorded with an accuracy above 0.7
    \item False Positive for the “with\_helmet” class and False Negative for the “no\_helmet” class often occur. This is due to the unbalanced available train set for the training process, where From 6,002 images in the dataset, there are 19,985 labels for “with\_helmet” and 6,601 labels for “no\_helmet”.
    \item The system works well at a distance of 1 m to 10 meters as proved by the test on distance difference conducted on 1 meter with the accuracy of 0.92, 3 meters with the accuracy of 0.97, 5 meter with the accuracy of 1, 7 meters with the accuracy of 1, and 10 meters with the accuracy of 1.
    \item The hardhat detection system can fairly work in low illuminance condition, as proved from the two tests at a dusk time when its fairly dark but the sky is still lit, with the accuracy of 0.93 and at night time when the background is dark with only one light source with the accuracy of 0.73. 
    \item The hardhat detection system works properly on Jetson Nano for real-time implementation with the accuracy of 0.93 and with 3-5 frames per second when run on 'hedec\_pretrain\_S' (A small version of the YOLOv5 model trained on hardhat detection dataset with pre-trained YOLOv5s weight)
\end{enumerate}
